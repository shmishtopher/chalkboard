The following section details the steps you need to follow to get chalkboard up and running on your system.

### Windows

#### Installing with Scoop
You can install all of the system requirements straight from Scoop's main bucket by running:
```
scoop install nodejs ffmpeg
```
You should then be able to install the chalkboard library using npm:
```
npm i -g shmishtopher/chalkboard
```
Calkboard should now be installed on your system.
